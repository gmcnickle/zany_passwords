## 🔄 How to Use These
Each weekly passphrase is:
- Easy to remember
- Funny enough to stick in your head
- Entropy-calculated and strength-checked
- Easy to adapt to meet complexity requirements

Use them as inspiration, not verbatim passwords — or modify them with symbols/numbers as described in the main [README](https://github.com/gmcnickle/zany_passwords/blob/main/README.md#adapting-for-password-requirements).
