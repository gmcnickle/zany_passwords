![Passphrase Of The Week](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmcnickle/zany_passwords/main/assets/right_to_bear_burritos.png)


To all patriots everywhere, your Zany Passphrase of the Week is:

> The Right to Bear Burritos Shall Not Be Infringed

Inspired by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution — originally written in 1791 — this week’s passphrase combines the spirit of personal liberty with the eternal pursuit of Mexican food.

Why does it work? Because it’s:

- Memorable – you’ll never forget the image.

- Zany – absurdity makes it sticky.

- Secure – it’s a recognizable structure, but altered just enough to confuse attackers.

Enjoy, and use responsibly.

> No actual burritos were infringed during the creation of this passphrase.
