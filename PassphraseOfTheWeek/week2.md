Your Zany Passphrase of the Week is:

> Encrypt Is the First Rule of Salvation Club

Salvation—digital salvation, at any rate—begins with encryption. None of our personal data would be safe without it. While encryption dates all the way back to ancient Egypt, the real breakthrough came in 1553, when Giovan Battista Bellaso introduced the first cipher that required a keyword for decryption. This marked a major milestone—one that ultimately led us to modern cryptography, where our most personal secrets are guarded behind walls of math.

With a brute-force cracking time of 22,600 years, “Encrypt Is the First Rule of Salvation Club” is a massive upgrade from your cousin’s “P@ssword1”.
