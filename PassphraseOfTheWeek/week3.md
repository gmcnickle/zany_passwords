Your Zany Passphrase of the Week is:

> In the Beginning, There Was Camouflage, and Then Came Rebellion

Like a digital Genesis, this phrase speaks of the primordial stew from which all covert ops and righteous insurrections are born.

- Camouflage hides the signal in the noise.
- Rebellion brings the fire to light it up.

With entropy as your canvas and encryption as your brush, go forth and secure boldly.

With a brute-force cracking time of 92.7 million years, “In the Beginning, There Was Camouflage, and Then Came Rebellion” is precisely the kind of phrase that makes even the elite at `0xC0FFEE` roll their eyes, mutter curses, and reach for something stronger.

Why does it work?
- Mythic tone with cyberpunk flair
- Strong nouns that double as archetypes
- High entropy, no nonsense

Enjoy, and use responsibly.
